- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @JorgeRodrigoLeclercq.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in everything!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Go.
- ðŸ’ž I really love anything related to programming and computers in general, but if I had to chose, I would say that I'm really interested in cybersecurity, specially in Blockchain. Also, cool visualizations/graphings never cease to amaze me and videogame development was the reason that I started coding. Finally, learning about clever algorithms and data structures is always DOPE (nothing feels better than a 100% in LeetCode).
